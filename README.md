# Physics-Models
Computational and Theoretical models created for optical physics research with Matlab:\
\
(1) Predicted temeprate effects on Er-Yb co-doped high-power fiber lasers based on rate equations including energy exchange between Er and Yb states\
\
(2) Learned Hg molecular dynamics, gained Hg, Hg2, Hg3, Hg4 states decay coefficients, based on a new rate equation model including three-body formation processes and updated experimental observations\
\
(3) Constructed a comprehensive quantum mechanical simulations of the photoassociation spectrum of the B ← X transition of XeI with a developed detailed potential description of the X state, including V-R coupled energy structure, achieving improved spectroscopic constants for B and X states\
\
(4) Decay rates fitting / learning of several molecules: ScI, YI, Hg2, Hg3\
\
(5) Labview, Matlab and Arduino programs to control spectrometers, lasers, oscilloscopes, photomultiplier tubes (PMT), photodiodes, energy meters etc... are also included in HardwareControl folder\
\
(6) most of the files names contain my first English name Wendy ^^
