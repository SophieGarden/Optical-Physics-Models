# Physics-Models
Simulation/computation models created for optical physics research including \
\
(1) Model of temeprate effects on Er-Yb co-doped high-power fiber lasers based on rate equations including energy exchange between Er and Yb states \
\
(2) Simulating Hg molecular dynamics, learning / predicting Hg, Hg2, Hg3, Hg4 states decay coefficients, based on a new rate equation model including three-body formaton process and reflected updated experimental observations \
\
(3) Comprehensive quantum mechanical simulations of the photoassociation spectrum of the B ← X transition of XeI • Developed detailed potential description of the X state , including V-R coupled energy structure, achieving improved spectroscopic constants for B and X states\
\
(4) Decay rates fitting / learning of several molecules: ScI, YI, Hg2, Hg3
